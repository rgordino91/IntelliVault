# IntelliVault

A plugin for IntelliJ IDEA to interact with JCR repositories via the FileVault tool which is packaged with Adobe Experience Manager.

This plugin is largely based upon, and liberally borrows from, [VaultClipse](http://vaultclipse.sourceforge.net/) which is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE for interacting with FileVault.

The plugin can be found in the [JetBrains IDEA Plugin Repository](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7328)
